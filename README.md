# Get Carbon Intensity

Makes use of the [API](https://carbon-intensity.github.io/api-definitions/#get-regional-intensity-from-to-postcode-postcode) from [CarbonIntensity.org.uk](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/).

So far provides a simple method to give carbon intensity as an integer based on postcode and from/to dates in ISO8601 format.

Basic tests are included.
